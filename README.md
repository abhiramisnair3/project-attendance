Face Recognition Project

Overview
The Face Recognition Project is a robust computer vision system that leverages deep learning techniques to detect and recognize faces in images and videos. It is suitable for applications such as security, authentication, and surveillance.

Features
- Accurate and efficient face detection and recognition
- Real-time video processing support
- Multi-face detection capability
- Customizable dataset for training and testing
- Scalable and optimized performance

Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7+
- pip package manager
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/face-recognition.git
   cd face-recognition
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Download necessary pre-trained models and place them in the designated directory.

Usage
Running Face Recognition
To perform image-based face recognition:
```sh
python recognize_face.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```
To run real-time face recognition using a webcam:
```sh
python recognize_face.py --video 0
```

Training on a Custom Dataset
1. Prepare a dataset by organizing images into labeled directories.
2. Train the model with:
   ```sh
   python train_model.py --dataset path/to/dataset
   ```

Dependencies
- OpenCV
- dlib
- Face Recognition Library
- TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning models)
